# Mother's Day Interactive Card 💌

> ✨ This project is adapted from the original [Image Changer Pop-up Tutorial](https://github.com/nasha-wanich/beginner-tutorial) by [nasha-wanich](https://github.com/nasha-wanich).  
> I customized the theme, layout, colors, and interactions to transform it into a Mother's Day card experience.

---

## Overview

This interactive card is a single-page web project that lets users:
- Engage with a "little character" by clicking themed buttons (e.g., feed, play, care)
- Watch the character grow through a sequence of images
- Receive a final message with a Mother's Day card or choose to play again

## 🎨 Customization Highlights

- Color theme changed to spring-like green/yellow palette
- Font replaced with Boutique Bitmap for supporting Traditional Chinese
- Button interactions redesigned with gradient hover animations
- Final state adds reset functionality and a hidden card reveal option
