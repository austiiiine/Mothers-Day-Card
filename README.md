# Mother's Day Interactive Card 💌

> This project is adapted from the original [Image Changer Pop-up Tutorial](https://github.com/nasha-wanich/beginner-tutorial) by [nasha-wanich](https://github.com/nasha-wanich).  
> I customized the illustrations, layout, colors, and interactions to transform it into a interactive digital Mother's Day card.


## Overview

This interactive card is a single-page web project that lets users:
- Engage with a "little character" by clicking themed buttons (e.g., feed, play, care)
- Watch the character grow through a sequence of images
- Receive a final message with a letter

## 🎨 Customization Highlights

- Self-drawn illustrations and icons
- Color theme changed to spring-like green/yellow palette
- Font replaced with Boutique Bitmap to support Traditional Chinese
- Progress bar added to enhance interactive experience
- Button interactions redesigned with gradient hover animations
- Final state adds reset functionality and a hidden card reveal option

## 🎮 Interactive Features

- Button sound effects: Each main interaction button plays a subtle click sound to enhance user feedback and engagement.

- Floating level-up text animation: Every time the user clicks a button to raise the level, a “Level Up!” message floats above the button, adding a playful game-like effect to reinforce the sense of progress.
